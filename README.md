# BookOfCharles
A website record stories from different people

This project is my first website after I learn about web development. It was used create-react-app as a frame, and a popular javascript stack MERN(MongoDB, express, react and node.js) from backend to frontend. The frontend deposit on netlify and backend deposit on heroku.

```
PORT = 'Port'
CONNECTION_URL = 'MongoDB_URL'
```
- **IMPORTANT!** After save changes, also change the name of **.env.example** to **.env**
- Run your backend project. It will run at your **localhost:"your modified port"**
```
